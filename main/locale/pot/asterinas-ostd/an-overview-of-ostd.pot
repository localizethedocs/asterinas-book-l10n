"With the Asterinas OSTD (Operating System Standard Library), you don't have "
"to learn the dark art of unsafe Rust programming and risk shooting yourself "

"Asterinas OSTD stands as a powerful and solid foundation for safe kernel "

msgstr ""

#: src/ostd/index.md:46
msgid ""
"In designing and implementing OSTD, we have risen to meet the challenge of "
"fulfilling [the aforementioned four criteria as demanded by the framekernel "
"architecture](../kernel/the-framekernel-architecture.md)."
msgstr ""

#: src/ostd/index.md:50
msgid ""
"Expressiveness is evident through Asterinas Kernel itself, where all system "
"calls, file systems, network protocols, and device drivers (e.g., Virtio "
"drivers) have been implemented in safe Rust by leveraging OSTD."
msgstr ""

#: src/ostd/index.md:58
msgid ""
"Adopting a minimalist philosophy, OSTD has a small codebase. At its core "
"lies the `ostd` crate, currently encompassing about 10K lines of code - a "
"figure that is even smaller than those of many microkernels. As OSTD "
"evolves, its codebase will expand, albeit at a relatively slow rate in "
"comparison to the OS services layered atop it."
msgstr ""

#: src/ostd/index.md:68
msgid ""
"The OSTD's efficiency is measurable through the performance metrics of its "
"APIs and the system calls of Asterinas Kernel. No intrinsic limitations have "
"been identified within Rust or the framekernel architecture that could "
"hinder kernel performance."

msgid ""
"Soundness, unlike the other three requirements, is not as easily quantified "
"or proved. While formal verification stands as the gold standard, it "
"requires considerable resources and time and is not an immediate priority. "
"As a more pragmatic approach, we will explain why the high-level design is "
"sound in the soundness analysis and rely on the many eyes of the community "
"to catch any potential flaws in the implementation."
