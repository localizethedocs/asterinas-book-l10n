"Lints help us improve the code quality and find more bugs. When suppressing "
"lints, the suppression should affect as little scope as possible, to make "
"readers aware of the exact places where the lint is generated, and to make "
"it easier for subsequent committers to maintain such lint."

"For example, if some methods in a trait are dead code, marking the entire "

"There is one exception: If it is clear enough that every member will trigger "
