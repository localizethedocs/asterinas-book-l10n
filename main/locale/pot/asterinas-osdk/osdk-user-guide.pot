"The Asterinas OSDK (short for Operating System Development Kit) is designed "
"to simplify the development of Rust operating systems. It aims to streamline "
"the process by leveraging [the framekernel architecture](../../kernel/the-"

"The OSDK provides a command-line tool `cargo-osdk`, which facilitates "
"project management for those developed on the framekernel architecture. "
"`cargo-osdk` can be used as a subcommand of Cargo. Much like Cargo for Rust "
"projects, `cargo-osdk` enables building, running, and testing projects "
"conveniently."
