"The \"RFC\" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a "
"consistent, transparent, structured path for the community to make \"big\" "

#: src/rfcs/0001-rfc-process.md:14
msgid ""
"As the Asterinas project grows in scale and community size, an informal "
"decision-making process becomes insufficient. A formalized process is "
"crucial for maintaining the quality and coherence of the project. Several "
"highly successful open-source projects have demonstrated the value of such a "
"process, including Rust ([RFCs](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/"
"introduction.html)), Fuchsia ([RFCs](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/"
"contribute/governance/rfcs)), Python ([Python Enhancement Proposals](https://"
