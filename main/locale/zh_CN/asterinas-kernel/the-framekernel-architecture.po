"Within the framekernel architecture, the entire OS resides in the same "
"address space (like a monolithic kernel) and is required to be written in "
"Rust. However, there's a twist---the kernel is partitioned in two halves: "
"the OS Framework (akin to a microkernel) and the OS Services. Only the OS "
"Framework is allowed to use _unsafe Rust_, while the OS Services must be "
"written exclusively in _safe Rust_."

"As a result, the memory safety of the kernel can be reduced to that of the "
"OS Framework, thus minimizing the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) associated "
"with the kernel's memory safety. On the other hand, the single address space "
"allows different parts of the kernel to communicate in the most efficient "
"means, e.g., function calls and shared memory. Thanks to the framekernel "
"architecture, Asterinas can offer both exceptional performance and enhanced "
"safety."

"Fortunately, our efforts to design and implement an OS framework meeting "

"framekernels, with different goals and tradeoffs."
