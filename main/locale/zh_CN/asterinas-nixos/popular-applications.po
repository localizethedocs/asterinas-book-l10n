"The [Nix package collection](https://search.nixos.org/packages) contains "
"over 120,000 packages. Many of them may already work out of the box on "
"Asterinas NixOS, but it is impractical to test every package and document "
"its support status. Instead, we group popular applications into categories "
"and document the ones we have verified to work."
