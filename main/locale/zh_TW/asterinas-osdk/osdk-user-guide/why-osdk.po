"OSDK is designed to elevate the development experience for Rust OS "
"developers to the ease and convenience typically associated with Rust "
"application development. Imagine crafting operating systems with the same "
"simplicity as applications! This is important to Asterinas as we believe "
"that the project's success is intricately tied to the productivity and "
"happiness of its developers. So the OSDK is here to upgrade your dev "
"experience."

"To be honest, writing OS kernels is hard. Even when you're using Rust, which "
"is a total game-changer for OS devs, the challenge stands tall. There is a "
"bunch of reasons."

"老實說，編寫作業系統內核非常困難。即便使用了對作業系統開發者來說具有劃時代意"
"義的 Rust 語言，挑戰依然巨大。這背後有許多原因。"

"First, it is hard to write a new kernel from scratch. Everything that has "
"been taken for granted by application developers are gone: no stack, no "
"heap, no threads, not even the standard I/O. It's just you and the no_std "
"world of Rust. You have to implement these basic programming primitives by "
"getting your hands dirty with the most low-level, error-prone, and nitty-"
"gritty details of computer architecture. It's a journey of learning, doing, "
"and a whole lot of finger-crossing to make sure everything clicks into "
"place. This means a high entry bar for new OS creators."

"首先，從零開始編寫一個新內核非常困難。應用程式開發者視為理所當然的一切都消失"
"了：沒有堆疊（stack）、沒有堆積（heap）、沒有執行緒，甚至連標準 I/O 都沒有。"
"你只能獨自面對 Rust 的 no_std 世界。你必須親自動手處理電腦架構中最底層、最容"
"易出錯且最繁瑣的細節，來實現這些基礎的程式設計原語（primitive）。這是一個不斷"
"學習、實作，並祈禱一切都能順利運作的過程。這也意味著對於新的作業系統創作者來"
"說，進入門檻非常高。"

"Second, it is hard to reuse OS-related libraries/crates across projects. "
"Think about it: most applications share a common groundwork, like libc, "
"Rust's std library, or an SDK. This isn't the case with kernels - they lack "
"this shared starting point, forcing each one to craft its own set of tools "
"from the ground up. Take device drivers, for example. They often need DMA-"
"capable buffers for chatting with hardware, but since every kernel has its "
"own DMA API flavor, a driver for one kernel is pretty much a no-go for "
"another. This means that for each new kernel out there, developers find "
"themselves having to 'reinvent the wheel' for many core components that are "
"standard in other kernels."

"Third, it is hard to do unit tests for OS functionalities. Unit testing "
"plays a crucial role in ensuring code quality, but when you're dealing with "
"a monolithic kernel like Linux, it's like a spaghetti bowl of intertwined "
"parts. Trying to isolate one part for testing? Forget about it. You'd have "
"to boot the whole kernel just to test a slice of it. Loadable kernel modules "
"are no exception: you can't test them without plugging them into a live "
"kernel. This monolithic approach to unit testing is slow and unproductive as "
"it performs the job of unit tests at a price of integration tests. "
"Regardless of the kernel architecture, Rust's built-in unit testing facility "
"is not suited for kernel development, leaving each kernel to hack together "
"their own testing frameworks."

"Last, it is hard to avoid writing unsafe Rust in a Rust kernel. Rust brings "
"safety... well, at least for Rust applications, where you can pretty much "
"stay in the wonderland of safe Rust all the way through. But for a Rust "
"kernel, one cannot help but use unsafe Rust. This is because, among other "
"reasons, low-level operations (e.g., managing page tables, doing context "
"switching, handling interrupts, and interacting with devices) have to be "
"expressed with unsafe Rust features (like executing assembly code or "
"dereferencing raw pointers). The misuse of unsafe Rust could lead to various "
"safety and security issues, as reported by [RustSec Advisory Database]"
"(https://rustsec.org). Despite having [a whole book](https://doc.rust-lang."
"org/nomicon/) to document \"the Dark Arts of Unsafe Rust\", unsafe Rust is "
"still tricky to use correctly, even among seasoned Rust developers."
