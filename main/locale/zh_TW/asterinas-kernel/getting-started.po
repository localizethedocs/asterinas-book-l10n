"Asterinas is a _secure_, _fast_, and _general-purpose_ OS kernel that "
"provides an _Linux-compatible_ ABI. It can serve as a seamless replacement "
"for Linux while enhancing _memory safety_ and _developer friendliness_."
msgstr ""

#: src/kernel/index.md:10
msgid ""
"Asterinas prioritizes memory safety by employing Rust as its sole "
"programming language and limiting the use of _unsafe Rust_ to a clearly "
"defined and minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB). This innovative approach, "
"known as [the framekernel architecture](the-framekernel-architecture.md), "
"establishes Asterinas as a more secure and dependable kernel option."

"Asterinas surpasses Linux in terms of developer friendliness. It empowers "
"kernel developers to (1) utilize the more productive Rust programming "
"language, (2) leverage a purpose-built toolkit called [OSDK]() to streamline "
"their workflows, and (3) choose between releasing their kernel modules as "
"open source or keeping them proprietary, thanks to the flexibility offered "
"by [MPL](../)."

"While the journey towards a production-grade OS kernel can be challenging, "
"we are steadfastly progressing towards our goal. Currently, Asterinas only "
"supports x86-64 VMs. However, [our aim for 2024](roadmap.md) is to make "
"Asterinas production-ready on x86-64 for both bare-metal and VM environments."
