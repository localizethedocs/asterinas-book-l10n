"Asterinas is a general-purpose OS kernel designed to support multiple CPU "
"architectures and a variety of use cases. Currently, it only supports x86-64 "
"VMs. Our roadmap includes the following plans:"

"Asterinas 是一款通用型作業系統內核，旨在支援多種 CPU 架構與多樣化的應用場景。"
"目前，它僅支援 x86-64 虛擬機器。我們的路線圖包含以下計劃："

"One of the biggest challenges for a new OS kernel is driver support. Linux "
"has been widely accepted due to its wide range of hardware support. As a "
"newcomer, Asterinas faces the challenge of implementing drivers for all "
"devices on a target platform, which would take a significant amount of time."

"To address this obstacle, we have decided to enter the cloud market first. "
"In an IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) cloud, workloads of different "
"tenants are run in VMs or [VM-style bare-metal servers](https://dl.acm.org/"
"doi/10.1145/3373376.3378507) for maximum isolation and elasticity. The main "
"device driver requirement for the VM environment is virtio, which is already "
"supported by Asterinas. Therefore, using Asterinas as the guest OS of a VM "
"or the host OS of a VM-style bare-metal server in production looks quite "
"feasible in the near future."

"Asterinas provides high assurance of memory safety thanks to [the "
"framekernel architecture](the-framekernel-architecture.md). Thus, in the "
"cloud setting, Asterinas is attractive for usage scenarios where Linux ABI "
"is necessary but Linux itself is considered insecure due to its large "
"Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and memory unsafety. Specifically, we are "
"focusing on two use cases:"

"VM-based TEEs: All major CPU architectures have introduced VM-based Trusted "
"Execution Environment (TEE) technology, such as ARM CCA, AMD SEV, and Intel "
"TDX. Applications running inside TEEs often handle private or sensitive "
"data. By running on a lightweight and memory-safe OS kernel like Asterinas, "
"they can greatly enhance security and privacy."

"Secure containers: In the cloud-native era, applications are commonly "
"deployed in containers. The popular container runtimes like runc and Docker "
"rely on the OS-level isolation enforced by Linux. However, [Linux containers "
"are prone to privilege escalation bugs](https://dl.acm.org/"
"doi/10.1145/3274694.3274720). With its safety and security prioritized "
"architecture, Asterinas can offer more reliable OS-level isolation, making "
"it ideal for secure containers."
