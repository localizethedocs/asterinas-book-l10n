"VM TEEs such as Intel TDX deserve a more secure option for its guest OS than "
"Linux. Linux, with its inherent memory safety issues and large Trusted "
"Computing Base (TCB), has long suffered from security vulnerabilities due to "
"memory safety bugs. Additionally, when Linux is used as the guest kernel "
"inside a VM TEE, it must process untrusted inputs (over 1500 instances in "
"Linux, per Intel's estimation) from the host (via hypercalls, MMIO, and "
"etc.). These untrusted inputs create new attack surfaces that can be "
"exploited through memory safety vulnerabilities, known as Iago attacks."

"Asterinas offers greater memory safety than Linux, particularly against Iago "
"attacks. Thanks to its framekernel architecture, the memory safety of "
"Asterinas relies solely on the Asterinas Framework, excluding the safe "
"device drivers built on top of the Asterinas Framework that may handle "
"untrusted inputs from the host. For more information, see [our talk on "
"OC3'24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQ5lpXujGo)."
