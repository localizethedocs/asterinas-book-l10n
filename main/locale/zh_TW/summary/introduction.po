msgstr ""

#: src/index.md:7
msgid ""
"Welcome to the documentation for Asterinas, an open-source project and "
"community focused on developing cutting-edge Rust OS kernels."

msgid "Book Structure"
msgstr ""

#: src/index.md:13
msgid "This book is divided into six distinct parts:"
msgstr ""

#: src/index.md:15
msgid "[Part 1: Asterinas NixOS](distro/)"
msgstr ""

#: src/index.md:17
msgid ""
"Asterinas NixOS is the first distribution built on top of the Asterinas "
"kernel. It is based on NixOS, leveraging its powerful configuration model "
"and rich package ecosystem, while swapping out the Linux kernel for "
"Asterinas."
msgstr ""

#: src/index.md:23
msgid "[Part 2: Asterinas Kernel](kernel/)"
msgstr ""

#: src/index.md:25
msgid ""
"Explore the modern OS kernel at the heart of Asterinas. Designed to realize "
"the full potential of Rust, Asterinas Kernel implements the Linux ABI in a "
"safe and efficient way. This means it can seamlessly replace Linux, offering "
"enhanced safety and security."
msgstr ""

#: src/index.md:31
msgid "[Part 3: Asterinas OSTD](ostd/)"
msgstr ""

#: src/index.md:33
msgid ""
"The Asterinas OSTD lays down a minimalistic, powerful, and solid foundation "
"for OS development. It's akin to Rust's `std` crate but crafted for the "
"demands of _safe_ Rust OS development. The Asterinas Kernel is built on this "
"very OSTD."
msgstr ""

#: src/index.md:39
msgid "[Part 4: Asterinas OSDK](osdk/guide/)"
msgstr ""

#: src/index.md:41
msgid ""
"The OSDK is a command-line tool that streamlines the workflow to create, "
"build, test, and run Rust OS projects that are built upon Asterinas OSTD. "
"Developed specifically for OS developers, it extends Rust's Cargo tool to "
"better suite their specific needs. OSDK is instrumental in the development "
"of Asterinas Kernel."

msgid "[Part 5: Contributing to Asterinas](to-contribute/)"
msgstr ""

#: src/index.md:51
msgid ""
"Asterinas is in its early stage and welcomes your contributions! This part "
"provides guidance on how you can become an integral part of the Asterinas "
"project."

#: src/index.md:56
msgid "[Part 6: Requests for Comments (RFCs)](rfcs/)"
msgstr ""

#: src/index.md:58

"Significant decisions in Asterinas are made through a transparent RFC "
"process. This part describes the RFC process and archives all approvaed RFCs."
