"Currently, Asterinas regularly releases two main artifacts for the Rust OS "
"developer community: the [OSDK](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-osdk) and "
"[OSTD](https://crates.io/crates/ostd). To support development with these "
"tools, we also publish companion Docker images on DockerHub, (i.e., "
"[`asterinas/osdk`](https://hub.docker.com/r/asterinas/osdk)). While the "
"Asterinas kernel is not yet ready for public binary release, its development "
"Docker images (i.e., [`asterinas/asterinas`](https://hub.docker.com/r/"
"asterinas/asterinas)) are released regularly."

"The `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` component aligns with the target version of "
"published crates, while the `DATE` component allows us to introduce non-"
"breaking updates to the Docker images without publishing a new crate "
"version. Normally, the version in `VERSION` and the version in "
"`DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION` (ignoring the `DATE` part) are identical, except "
"during the version bump process."
