"In RISC-V, we have experienced that defining two labels with the same name "
"in different modules can nondeterministically cause duplicate symbol error. "
"The `.L` prefix does not help. Therefore, add custom prefixes to your labels "
"to avoid name clashes. Nevertheless, use `.global` to export symbols that "
