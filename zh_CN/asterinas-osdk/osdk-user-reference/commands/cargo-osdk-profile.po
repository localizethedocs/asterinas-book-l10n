"The profile command is used to collect stack traces when running the target "
"kernel in QEMU. It attaches to the GDB server, initiated with the run "
"subcommand, and collects the stack trace periodically. The collected "
"information can be used to directly generate a flame graph, or be stored for "
"later analysis using [the original flame graph tool](https://github.com/"
"brendangregg/FlameGraph)."
